    <h1>Listen, I know that paying your bills, especially on time, may not be
        high on your list of priorities.  But something motivated you and brought
        you to this page, so in some way you are telling yourself it's time to start
        dealing with your big pile of invoices.</h1>

    <p>And that's exactly the problem isn't it?  The bigger the pile, the less likely you are
to takle those invoices, and so time passes.  And the more time passes, the bigger your
pile grows and the more disorganized it becomes.  It's a vicious cycle.</p>
