    <p>
      Paperlib automatically organizes your scanned documents and keeps track of
      your paid and unpaid invoices, so that the minute you want to pay your bills,
      you can.  It's better than having them lay around on your hard drive, clutering
      your desktop, or in some (not so safe) cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      It lets you search and instantly find the document you need, because it knows you
      are specifically looking for invoices (or contracts *) from your insurance company
      (or telco, or dentist or else), and not for products or other irrevelant information
      about them.
