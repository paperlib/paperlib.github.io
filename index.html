    Paperlib for Mac
  </h1>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>
      Paperlib automatically organizes your scanned documents and keeps track of
      your paid and unpaid invoices, so that the minute you want to pay your bills,
      you can.  It's better than having them lay around on your hard drive, clutering
      your desktop, or in some (not so safe) cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      It lets you search and instantly find the document you need, because it knows you
      are specifically looking for invoices (or contracts *) from your insurance company
      (or telco, or dentist, you name it), and not searching for products these might
      offer or other related but irrevelant information.
    </p>

      Paperlib is currently in beta, but I'd be so happy to keep you posted
      on the updates (your email won't be used for anything else.)
